I am a university student who love learning about stuffs. This is a blog where I write about a lot of unrelated stuffs for my own collection to pratice my English writing skill. Topic that may be covered:
- Biology/healthy/medicine (currently the weakest area)
- Random romantic stories
- IT / Design
- Data Analytics + Stastics (I will mostly write articles as a way for me to apply the freyman method in learning)
- Japanese
- Data visulizations
- Game theory
